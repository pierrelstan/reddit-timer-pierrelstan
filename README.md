## The skills that I learned while building the project:
  ***


$~$


- Creating [pixel-perfect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=en-US) designs
- Planning and implementing a complex UI component
- Implement data fetching with error handling
- Writing integration tests
- Professional Git workflow with pull requests
- Code reviews
- Continuous integration

$~$

## Technical decisions:
***

The reason why I choose not to manage the state of the app with redux is because the application perform simple actions.

I created  a custom hook instead  to encapsulate hook-related logic that can be re-used in the future.

The file contains three functions:

- A recursive function called fetchPaginatedPosts which is responsible for sending 5 subsequent requests to the Reddit API.

- A function  groupPostsPerDayAndHour that  nested 2D array that contains the number of posts grouped by week day and hour

- The custom hook called useFetchPosts which triggers the data fetching, stores the result in a state variable, and keeps track of the loading state.

## About This Project
 This course mimics a professional real-world development environment,
designs were provided via Figma. The project was split into small tasks using ClickUp as a project management tool. I created a pull request for every task. The code was reviewed line by line by mentor Tara a bot  and Johannes a senior developer.

$~$
I was free to choose any technical stack, packages, and coding styles to finish the project as long as I met the acceptance criteria of a given task. The only limitation was to use React.

$~$


 ## Complicate business logic:
 ***
 - FetchPaginatedPosts.js
