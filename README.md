## Technical decisions:
***

The reason why I choose not to manage the state of the app with redux is because the application perform simple actions.

I created  a custom hook instead  to encapsulate hook-related logic that can be re-used in the future.

The file contains three functions:

- A recursive function called fetchPaginatedPosts which is responsible for sending 5 subsequent requests to the Reddit API.

- A function  groupPostsPerDayAndHour that  nested 2D array that contains the number of posts grouped by week day and hour

- The custom hook called useFetchPosts which triggers the data fetching, stores the result in a state variable, and keeps track of the loading state.

## About This Project
 This course mimics a professional real-world development environment,
designs were provided via Figma. The project was split into small tasks using ClickUp as a project management tool. I created a pull request for every task. The code was reviewed line by line by mentor Tara a bot  and Johannes a senior developer.

\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
I was free to choose any technical stack, packages, and coding styles to finish the project as long as I met the acceptance criteria of a given task. The only limitation was to use React.

\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;


 ## Complicate business logic:
 ***
 - FetchPaginatedPosts.js
